# Arithmatic Operators
#     +  addition
#     -  subtraction
#     *  multiplication
#     /  division (returns float)
#     // floor division (returns just quotient)
#     ** exponentiation (x**3 = x cubed)
#     %  modulo (returns reminder)


# Assignment Operator
#     =  (a = 4)
#     += (a += 4, meaning a = a + 4)
#     -+, *=, /=, //=, %=, **=, &=, |=, ^=, >>=, <<=


# Comparison Operator
#     ==  Equal to
#     !=  Not equal to
#     <   Less than
#     >   Greater than
#     <=  Less than or equal to
#     >=  Greater than or equal to


# Logical Operator
#     and
#     or
#     not


# Bitwise Operator
#     &  bitwise AND
#     |  bitwise OR
#     ^  bitwise XOR
#     ~  bitwise NOT
#     << Zero-fill left shift
#     >> Zero-fill right shift


# Membership Operator
#     in
#     not in


# Identity Operator
#     is
#     is not
